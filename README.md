for Probe Data Analysis for Road Slope 

Goal: 

Input: Probe data and map (see the attachment)

-The raw probe points in Germany collected in 9 months

-The link data for the links that probe points can be map-matched to.

Tasks:
-- map match probe points to road links

-- derive road slope for each road link

-- evaluate the derived road slope with the surveyed road slope in the link data file
